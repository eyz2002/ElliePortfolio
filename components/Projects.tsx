            description: " Developed a neural network (CNN) for machine learning to predict the level of dementia severity from MRI images. Incorporated weighted-cross entropy loss to account for the unbalanced dataset. Implemented optimization and regularization strategies such as Adam and dropout. Applied the Keras package from the TensorFlow library to preprocess images.",

Program allowed for communication over a network by accepting TCP connections from clients. Implemented concurrency and synchronization primitives to coordinate access to shared data on a remote server. Utilized auxiliary and wrapper functions within the CSAPP library for sockets, signals, threads, and semaphores.",

Used abstract classes and polymorphism, as well as operator overloading, to define gameplay/piece movement. Program readily allowed for addition of new arbitrary pieces, proving its optimal design. Employed gdb and valgrind to check for errors/memory leaks.",
